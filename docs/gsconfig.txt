Installation:
    <<pip install gsconfig>> is not working.
    Instead, you should use <<pip install gsconfig-py3>>


Usage:
    for using the REST of gsconif package:
        You should add /rest/ at the end of the 'service_url'

Tips:
    For deleting store and layer together, you should only delete store.
